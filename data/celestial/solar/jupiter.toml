description = """
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
It is a gas giant with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets
in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of
the Sun. Its diameter is eleven times that of Earth and a tenth that of the Sun.
Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with an orbital
period of 11.86 years. It is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's
night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since prehistoric times.
