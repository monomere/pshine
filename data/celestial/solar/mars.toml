description = """
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because
it is covered in iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".
Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo
features have made it a common subject for telescope viewing. It is classified
as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar System's planets
with a diameter of 6,779 km (4,212 mi). In terms of orbital motion, a Martian
solar day (sol) is equal to 24.6 hours, and a Martian solar year is equal to
1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days). Mars has two natural satellites that are
small and irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos.
