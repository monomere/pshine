description = """
Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is
the closest in mass and size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has by
far the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed mostly of
carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the
surface it has a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure
of 92 atm.
