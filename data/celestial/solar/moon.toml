The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384,399 km
(238,854 mi; about 30 times Earth's diameter). The Moon's orbital period (lunar month) and
rotation period (lunar day) are synchronized by Earth's gravitational pull at 29.5 Earth days,
making the same side of the Moon always face Earth. The Moon's pull on Earth is the main
driver of Earth's tides.
