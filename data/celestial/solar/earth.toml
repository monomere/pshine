description = """
Earth is the third planet from the Sun. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its
global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land,
most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.
Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets
of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers,
and atmospheric water combined.
