description = """
Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System.
It is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity
as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless
impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest crater,
Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi), which is about one-third
the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, 
Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults
and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.
